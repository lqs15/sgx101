title: Technion 2018  Summer School Program
---

During the 7th Summer School on Cyber and Computer Security held by Technion Insrael Institute of Technology and Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center, several talks were given on trusted execution and hardware side channels. Talks on day 1 focus mostly on Intel SGX technology. Those from day 2 are more on security issues on trusted execution. On day 3, more side channel related topics were discussed.

This page includes selected talks with slides. Original website can be found [here](http://cyber.technion.ac.il/2018-summer-school-on-cyber-computer-security/2018-summer-school-program/). Unfortunately, videos of those talks are not available online.

# Day 1

## Software Guard Extension – from dream to reality

#### Speaker: Ittai Anati

#### Abstract: 

> In 2015, Intel launched its 6th generation Core, codenamed
Skylake, that implements a new ISA for security – Intel® SGX. We’ll
start with the fundamentals of SGX1, and gradually dive deeper into more
advanced topics of SGX.
1. SGX1 fundamentals
2. Advanced SGX1 topics and SGX2
3. Flexible launch control, VMM Oversubscription, key separation and
sharing
4. Provisioning, attestation and recovery

## Attacks and Defenses for Intel SGX

#### Speaker: Taesoo Kim

#### Abstract: 

> The Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)---a gamechanging
feature introduced in the recent Intel Skylake CPU---is a new
technology likely to make secure and trustworthy computing in a hostile
environment practical. At a high level, SGX consists of a set of new
instructions that can be used to create secure regions (i.e., enclaves) to
defeat attacks that aim to steal or tamper with the data within an enclave.
Without a doubt, we expect that SGX will allow developers to protect
sensitive code and data from unauthorized access or modification by
software running at higher privilege levels such as an OS or a hypervisor.

> However, SGX is merely a set of instructions; it lacks support from the
OS and libraries. These deficiencies allow programmers to easily
introduce naive yet preventable bugs that often lead to critical security
holes in an enclave program. Further, designing a correct and secure SGX
infrastructure is also far from straightforward; enclave programs rely on
the support of an underlying OS, but their security models exclude the OS
from the TCB. This unconventional dependency makes various attack
vectors, which are often considered impractical in a traditional setting,
immediate and practical, especially in a cloud environment.

> In this tutorial, I will first provide a security-focused introduction to Intel
SGX, including its internal mechanisms to implement the security
features. Then, I will explain known security concerns, including recent
research outputs from the community: e.g., memory safety issues,
cache/branch side-channel attacks, and rowhammer attacks. I will not just
only demonstrate these attacks but also guide you to the proper defense
mechanisms.

# Day 2

## Application-oriented Security: Secrets Management and SideChannel Protection for TEEs

#### Speaker: Christof Fetzer

#### Abstract:

> This tutorial will first introduce the problems one faces when
trying to run unmodified applications inside of TEEs. Alternative
solutions are presented but the focus will be on the use of cross-compilers
and runtime support to execute applications inside of TEEs.
We will introduce some example applications running inside of SGX
using the SCONE platform.

> Second, we will motivate the need for integrating secrets management
and remote attestation. We will motivate the problem of remote
attestation and configuration management and show how to solve this.
We show how that helps with transparent protection of files and secrets.

> We show how attestation can help to protect against some side-channel
attacks. The main focus will, however, on a novel approach to protect against
L1/L2-based side channels attacks.

## The house is built on sand: exploiting hardware glitches and side channels in perfect software

#### Speaker: Herbert Bos

#### Abstract:

>For years, we have tried to address security problems by
fixing software bugs and misconfigurations. For critical systems we may
even choose to formally verify software to guarantee the absence of bugs.
However, the question is whether getting rid of bugs in the software is
sufficient. In this talk, I will discuss vulnerabilities in hardware that allow
attackers to compromise systems even in the absence of software bugs. In
particular, these vulnerabilities offer attackers the read and write
primitives needed to leak and modify sensitive information. For the write
primitive, we will look at the evolution of the Rowhammer vulnerability
in DRAM chips that has matured from a mere curiosity to a serious attack
vector across all sorts of systems in just a few years. For read primitives,
we will discuss several advanced side channel vulnerabilities, such as
found in memory deduplication and Translation Lookaside Buffers.

# Day 3

## From black to white (box) attacks on secure systems - Or why do your light bulbs need a firmware update

#### Speaker: Eyal Ronen

#### Abstract: 

> I will go over the process of RE and attacking the Philips Hue.
It is partially based on the IoT Goes Nuclear paper (iotworm.eyalro.net).
But I will mostly describe the process of breaking the secure SoC,
including what we tried and didn't work.

##  Side-Channel Attacks on Human Secrets

#### Speaker: Yossi Oren

#### Abstract: 

>Side-channel analysis techniques have been traditionally
applied toward the recovery of computer-related secrets such as
cryptographic keys. Humans, however, also share secrets of their own
with their computers – for example, their browsing habits, their political
or religious beliefs, or sensitive information about their health. This secret
information is increasingly vulnerable to emerging low-cost side-channel
attacks that are highly scalable, employing malicious peripheral devices
or turning components of a system against itself. There are
countermeasures which can be applied to protect systems from the theft
of human secrets via side channel attacks. These countermeasures,
however, have different designs, and exact different costs, than those
designed to protect against the theft of cryptographic secrets.

## What if your phone’s battery could talk? Inference attacks using malicious battery

#### Speaker: Mark Silberstein

#### Abstract: 

> Mobile devices are equipped with increasingly smart batteries
designed to provide responsiveness and extended lifetime. However, such
smart batteries may present a threat to users’ privacy. We demonstrate
that the phone’s power trace sampled from the battery at 1KHz holds
enough information to recover a variety of sensitive information. We
show techniques to infer typed characters to reduce the password search
space; to accurately recover browsing history in an open-world setup; to
reliably detect incoming calls and the photo shots including their lighting
conditions. Combined with a novel exfiltration covert channel that allows
communication from the battery directly to a remote server without installing
software on the phone, these attacks turn the malicious battery
into a stealthy surveillance device. We deconstruct the attack by
analyzing its robustness to sampling rate and execution conditions, and
identify the sources of the information leakage to find the best way to
defend against the attacks. We discover that an attacker can distinguish
the browsed website by observing the GPU or DRAM power traces alone.
However, the CPU and other power-hungry peripherals such as a touch
screen are often the primary sources of fine-grain information leakage.
We highlight the challenge to defend against the attacks by designing and
evaluating several possible mitigation mechanisms. In summary, our
work shows the feasibility of the malicious battery and motivates further
research into system and application-level defenses to fully mitigate this
emerging threat.

at the Symposium on Privacy Enhancement Technologies (2018)
