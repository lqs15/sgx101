SSLab represents the [Systems Software & Security Lab](https://gts3.org/) from 
Georgia Institute of Technology led by [Prof. Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/).

We have been actively working on SGX related research.
These research projects can be broadly classified into three different
categories: System Design, Defense, and Attack.

- Please take a look at our achievements on [Attacks and Defenses for Intel SGX](files/ccs-sgx-exploits.pdf). Demo videos can be viewed under [SGX Bootstrap/CCS17 Tutorial](pages/ccs17.html).
